# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
We have been asked to analyze the ride-sharing data by city type: Rural, Urban, and Suburban. We will analyze the data to see how the weekly fares differ between each city type. This analysis will allow the executives at Pyber to make informed decisions.

## Results

Below is a snapshot of the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver for each type of city.

  - Urban had the largest totals but the average fare per ride and per driver were the lowest.

Below is a snapshot of the ride fare totals by city type for the first four months of 2019.

- Urban saw the largest fare totals across all months shown. 

## Summary
Based on the analysis and the provided results, here are three recommendations for Pyber:
- Urban is the only type with more total drivers than total rides. We recommend an ad campaign to get more people to sign up and get a ride. An example would be 50% off first ride.
- In the suburban type, there were more total rides than total drivers. Drivers are giving more rides. We recommend offering a type of subscription to get riders to continue to take multiple rides. This could also help with word of mouth advertising.
- In the rural areas, we saw the largest average fare per driver. We also saw that there are more total rides than there are total drivers. There is a market here for the drivers. We can share this internally with our drivers to get them to accept rides in the rural areas or get additional drivers to sign up.
